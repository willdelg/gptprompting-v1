AUDIO,0x95D9F4BC443956E7,ADD_PED_TO_CONVERSATION,"index:int, ped:Ped, p2:char*",void,"```
4 calls in the b617d scripts. The only one with p0 and p2 in clear text:
AUDIO::ADD_PED_TO_CONVERSATION(5, l_AF, ""DINAPOLI"");
=================================================
One of the 2 calls in dialogue_handler.c p0 is in a while-loop, and so is determined to also possibly be 0 - 15.

NOTE: ones that are -1, 0 - 35 are determined by a function where it gets a TextLabel from a global then runs,
_GET_TEXT_SUBSTRING and depending on what the result is it goes in check order of 0 - 9 then A - Z then z (lowercase). So it will then return 0 - 35 or -1 if it's 'z'. The func to handle that ^^ is func_67 in dialog_handler.c atleast in TU27 Xbox360 scripts.
p0 is -1, 0 - 35
p1 is a char or string (whatever you wanna call it)
p2 is Global 10597 + i * 6. 'i' is a while(i < 70) loop
p3 is again -1, 0 - 35
p4 is again -1, 0 - 35
p5 is either 0 or 1 (bool ?)
p6 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)
p7 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)
p8 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)
p9 is 0 - 3 (Determined by func_60 in dialogue_handler.c)
p10 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)
p11 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)
p12 is unknown as in TU27 X360 scripts it only goes to p11.

AUDIO,0xBC9AE166038A5CEC,PLAY_PAIN,"ped:Ped, painID:int, p1:int",void,"**Warning**:

Parameters are wrong after painID. To preserve C-Sharp backwards compatibility, we can't add or remove parameters.

Correct parameters should be:\
`PLAY_PAIN(Ped ped, int painID, float p3, bool createNetEvent)`

Check the *examples* section for the correct usage of this native.

**Description:**

Plays a pain sound. A maximum of 33 pain IDs are allowed.\
`createNetEvent` creates a `CPedPlayPainEvent` when set to true.

Below is a list of all the pain IDs (Asterisks indicate that sounds can play in a Low, Medium or High fashion), for example: `PAIN_LOW_GENERIC`. The corresponding pain strings belong to the game exe.

**Pain IDs:**

*   0: PAIN_\*\_GENERIC (Low, Medium, High)
*   1: UNUSED
*   2: UNUSED
*   3: SCREAM_PANIC (Nothing can be heard)

This is the same as PLAY_PED_AMBIENT_SPEECH_NATIVE and PLAY_PED_AMBIENT_SPEECH_AND_CLONE_NATIVE but it will allow you to play a speech file from a specific voice file. It works on players and all peds, even animals.

The first param is the ped you want to play it on, the second is the speech name, the third is the voice name, the fourth is the speech param, and the last param is usually always 0.

I filled p1-p6 (the floats) as they are as other natives with 6 floats in a row are similar and I see no other method. So if a test from anyone proves them wrong please correct.  
p7 (length) determines the length of the spline, affects camera path and duration of transition between previous node and this one  
p8 big values ~100 will slow down the camera movement before reaching this node

7: Smoothed lead-in, longer smoothed lead-out
8: Longer lead-in and lead-out than 6, didn't drop node
9: Constant acceleration
10: Constant deceleration. Dropped 2 nodes in testing.
11: Same as 0
12: 10 but slower lead-in, reaches end node less early
13: Extremely close to 3, slightly longer lead-in/lead-out
14: Constant acceleration, dropped last 2 nodes in testing and halted (?)
15: Very similar to 10, did not drop any nodes.
16: Long lead-in, dropped 2 nodes in testing, very long leadout.
17: Constant acceleration, slower speed-up than 9
18: Same as 17 is to 9, slightly longer lead-out, lingers at end node
19: Very long lead in and out
20: Very long, gradual lead-in acceleration at start, gets extremely fast
21: Same as 20 but for constant deceleration
22: 20 and 21 combined, long linger at end node. Dropped 2 nodes in testing
23: Constant acceleration, doesn't complete path before it stops
24: Same as 23 but with constant deceleration, but completes path
25: 23 and 24 combined, insanely fast at middle.
26: No noticable lead-in, misses last 2 nodes in testing
27+: Alternates between 0 and 26

The above is documented and graphed at [Spline Cam Interp Graphs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ejyiMcEYrhhQOL0mLe8664UN-vU4Oh-SBqQnVcKlFIk/edit?usp=sharing)

```

Using 1-3 will result in misalignment from the passed durations for the spline nodes, the overall duration will remain but other nodes will be shortened if smoothing anything.

Graph below demonstrates interpolation between 0-1000 and back 10 times.

rotationOrder refers to the order yaw pitch roll is applied; value ranges from 0 to 5 and is usually *2* in scripts.

What you use for rotationOrder when getting must be the same as rotationOrder when setting the rotation.

What it returns is the yaw on the z part of the vector, which makes sense considering R* considers z as vertical. Here's a picture for those of you who don't understand pitch, yaw, and roll:

### Rotation Orders

*   **0**: ZYX - Rotate around the z-axis, then the y-axis and finally the x-axis.

*   **2**: ZXY - Rotate around the z-axis, then the x-axis and finally the y-axis.

Creates a checkpoint. Returns the handle of the checkpoint.  
20/03/17 : Attention, checkpoints are already handled by the game itself, so you must not loop it like markers.
Parameters:  
* type - The type of checkpoint to create. See below for a list of checkpoint types.  
* pos1 - The position of the checkpoint.  
* pos2 - The position of the next checkpoint to point to.  
* diameter - The diameter of the checkpoint.
* color - The color of the checkpoint.  
* reserved - Special parameter, see below for details. Usually set to 0 in the scripts.  
Checkpoint types (prior to game build 2189):  
0-4---------Cylinder: 1 arrow, 2 arrow, 3 arrows, CycleArrow, Checker  
5-9---------Cylinder: 1 arrow, 2 arrow, 3 arrows, CycleArrow, Checker

Reason for this is that those fx's might already have colors ""baked into them"" which then start to act as a ""mixing palette"", resulting in a different color than expected. A hypothetical example of this would be if the fx itself is already full (bright) red (RGB: 1.0, 0.0, 0.0) and you then set the color to (bright) green (RGB: 0.0, 1.0, 0.0), that it MIGHT result in Yellow (RGB: 1.0, 1.0, 0.0).

This doc previously stated that the set color is **NOT** networked, however it does actually turns out to be networked. Tested with all fireworks effects and several other FX effects resulted in colored fx effects on all clients when used in combination with [START_NETWORKED_PARTICLE_FX_NON_LOOPED_AT_COORD](#\_0xF56B8137DF10135D).

independent of the player's safe zone configuration.

These values are equivalent to `alignX` and `alignY` in `common:/data/ui/frontend.xml`, which can be used as a baseline
for default alignment.

Valid values for `horizontalAlign`, from original documentation:

*   **C (67)** - Center: DRAW_TEXT starts in the middle of the screen, while DRAW_RECT starts on the right; both move with
    the right side of the screen.
*   **L (76)** - Left: Anchors to the left side, DRAW_RECT starts on the left side of the screen, same as DRAW_TEXT when
    centered.
*   **R (82)** - Right: DRAW_TEXT starts on the left side (normal 0,0), while DRAW_RECT starts some short distance away
    from the right side of the screen, both move with the right side of the screen.

Valid values for `verticalAlign`, from original documentation:

*   **B (66)** - Bottom: DRAW_RECT starts about as far as the middle of the map from the bottom, while DRAW_TEXT is about
    rather centered.
*   **C (67)** - Center: It starts at a certain distance from the bottom, but the distance is fixed, the distance is
    different from 66.
*   **T (84)** - Top: Anchors to the top, DRAW_RECT starts on the top of the screen, DRAW_TEXT just below it.

Using any other value (including 0) will result in the safe zone not being taken into account for this draw. The
canonical value for this is 'I' (73).

For example, you can use `SET_SCRIPT_GFX_ALIGN(0, 84)` to only scale on the Y axis (to the top), but not change the X
axis.

To reset the value, use `RESET_SCRIPT_GFX_ALIGN`."

Disables the phone up-button, oddly enough.   
i.e.: When the phone is out, and this method is called with false as it's parameter, the phone will not be able to scroll up. However, when you use the down arrow key, it's functionality still, works on the phone.   
When the phone is not out, and this method is called with false as it's parameter, you will not be able to bring up the phone. Although the up arrow key still works for whatever functionality it's used for, just not for the phone.  
This can be used for creating menu's when trying to disable the phone from being used.

    In order to use this Native you MUST have controls 239, 240, 237, 238 enabled!
    This native, due to its erroneous redundancy of the returned boolean value, works differently in C#: shifting the parameters (where `received` becomes `selectionType` and so on making the fourth parameter unused and always 0)."
HUD,0xB2798643312205C5,_GET_TEXT_SUBSTRING_SAFE,"text:char*, position:int, length:int, maxLength:int",char*,"```
Returns a substring of a specified length starting at a specified position. The result is guaranteed not to exceed the specified max length.
NOTE: The 'maxLength' parameter might actually be the size of the buffer that is returned. More research is needed. -CL69
Example:
// Condensed example of how Rockstar uses this function
strLen = HUD::GET_LENGTH_OF_LITERAL_STRING(MISC::GET_ONSCREEN_KEYBOARD_RESULT());
subStr = HUD::_GET_TEXT_SUBSTRING_SAFE(MISC::GET_ONSCREEN_KEYBOARD_RESULT(), 0, strLen, 63);

pausemenu.xml defines some specific menu options using 'context'. Context is basically a 'condition'.

The `*NONE*` part of the context section means that whatever is being defined, will NOT be active if any or all of the conditions after `*NONE*` are met.

This basically allows you to hide certain menu sections, or things like instructional buttons.

You need to center the minimap manually as well as change/lock it's zoom and angle in order for it to appear correctly on the minimap.

The radius1 and radius2 might actually not be a radius at all, but that's what it seems to me testing them in-game. But they may be 'angle' floats instead, considering this native is named ADD_STUNT_JUMP\_**ANGLED**.

Info about the specific 'parameter sections':

**x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 and radius1:**

First coordinates are for the jump entry area, and the radius that will be checked around that area. So if you're not exactly within the coordinates, but you are within the outter radius limit then it will still register as entering the stunt jump. Note as mentioned above, the radius is just a guess, I'm not really sure about it's exact purpose.

**x3, y3, z3, x4, y4, z4 and radius2:**

Next part is the landing area, again starting with the left bottom (nearest to the stunt jump entry zone) coordinate, and the second one being the top right furthest away part of the landing area. Followed by another (most likely) radius float, this is usually slightly larger than the entry zone 'radius' float value, just because you have quite a lot of places where you can land (I'm guessing).

**camX, camY and camZ:**

The final coordinate in this native is the Camera position. Rotation and zoom/FOV is managed by the game itself, you just need to provide the camera location.

**unk1, unk2 and unk3:**

Not sure what these are for, but they're always `150, 0, 0` in decompiled scripts.

Visualized example in-game:

Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.
Parameters:
str1 - String to be compared.
str2 - String to be compared.
matchCase - Comparison will be case-sensitive.
maxLength - Maximum number of characters to compare. A value of -1 indicates an infinite length.
Returns:
A value indicating the relationship between the strings:
<0 - The first non-matching character in 'str1' is less than the one in 'str2'. (e.g. 'A' < 'B', so result = -1)
0 - The contents of both strings are equal.
>0 - The first non-matching character in 'str1' is less than the one in 'str2'. (e.g. 'B' > 'A', so result = 1)
Examples:
MISC::COMPARE_STRINGS(""STRING"", ""string"", false, -1); // 0; equal
MISC::COMPARE_STRINGS(""TESTING"", ""test"", false, 4); // 0; equal

According to how I understood this in the freemode script alone,
The first parameter is determined by a function named, func_5749 within the freemode script which has a list of all the vehicles and a set price to return which some vehicles deals with globals as well. So the first parameter is basically the set in stone insurance cost it's gonna charge you for that specific vehicle model.
The second parameter whoever put it was right, they call GET_ENTITY_MODEL with the vehicle as the paremeter.
The third parameter is the network handle as they call their little struct<13> func or atleast how the script decompiled it to look which in lamens terms just returns the network handle of the previous owner based on DECOR_GET_INT(vehicle, ""Previous_Owner"").
The fourth parameter is a bool that returns true/false depending on if your bank balance is greater then 0.
The fifth and last parameter is a bool that returns true/false depending on if you have the money for the car based on the cost returned by func_5749. In the freemode script eg,
bool hasTheMoney = MONEY::_GET_BANK_BALANCE() < carCost.

//Setup the array

	Any veh[arrSize];

PED,0x4E90D746056E273D,_SET_PED_EMISSIVE_INTENSITY,"ped:Ped, intensity:float",void,"This native sets the glow intensity of illuminated clothing items.

This native does **NOT** need to be executed every tick.
This native is **NOT** synced with other connected players, you will have to set the opacity on the ped on all clients individually.

Glow intensity is a value between `0.0` and `1.0`.

In some older decompiled scripts this is known as `_SET_PED_REFLECTION_INTENSITY`.
Since there's no joaat hash for this, I find `_SET_PED_ILLUMINATED_CLOTHING_GLOW_INTENSITY` more descriptive than `_SET_PED_REFLECTION_INTENSITY`.

Use [`GetPedIlluminatedClothingGlowIntensity`](#\_0x1461B28A06717D68) to get the illuminated clothing glow intensity of a specific ped.

Intensity: `1.0`:

Return variable is never used in R*'s scripts.  
Not sure what p2 does. It seems like it would be a time judging by it's usage in R*'s scripts, but didn't seem to affect anything in my testings.

p7 is probably the force of the fall, but untested, so I left the variable name the same.  
p8 to p13 are always 0f in R*'s scripts.  
(Simplified) Example of the usage of the function from R*'s scripts:

Use GET_IDEAL_PLAYER_SWITCH_TYPE for the best switch type. Or just auto, because it calls the same function in executable.

Note: DO NOT, use SWITCH_TYPE_LONG with flag 513. It leaves you stuck in the clouds. You'll have to call STOP_PLAYER_SWITCH() to return to your ped.  
Flag 8 w/ SWITCH_TYPE_LONG will zoom out 3 steps, then zoom in 2/3 steps and stop on the 3rd and just hang there.

p0 is between 0 and 4 in the scripts.

p2, p3 and p4 is only one parameter sometimes in the scripts. Most likely a Vector3 hence p2, p3 and p4 are coordinates.

Looks like only the player can be arrested this way. Peds react and try to arrest you if you task them, but the player charater doesn't do anything if tasked to arrest another ped.

You need to call PED::SET_BLOCKING_OF_NON_TEMPORARY_EVENTS after TASK_BOAT_MISSION in order for the task to execute.

I marked p2 as targetVehicle as all these shooting related tasks seem to have that in common.
I marked p6 as distanceToShoot as if you think of GTA's Logic with the native SET_VEHICLE_SHOOT natives, it won't shoot till it gets within a certain distance of the target.
I marked p7 as pedAccuracy as it seems it's mostly 100 (Completely Accurate), 75, 90, etc. Although this could be the ammo count within the gun, but I highly doubt it. I will change this comment once I find out if it's ammo count or not.

The ped will walk or run towards goToLocation, aiming towards goToLocation or focusLocation (depending on the aimingFlag) and shooting if shootAtEnemies = true to any enemy in his path.
If the ped is closer than noRoadsDistance, the ped will ignore pathing/navmesh and go towards goToLocation directly. This could cause the ped to get stuck behind tall walls if the goToLocation is on the other side. To avoid this, use 0.0f and the ped will always use pathing/navmesh to reach his destination.
If the speed is set to 0.0f, the ped will just stand there while aiming, if set to 1.0f he will walk while aiming, 2.0f will run while aiming.
The ped will stop aiming when he is closer than distanceToStopAt to goToLocation.
I still can't figure out what unkTrue is used for. I don't notice any difference if I set it to false but in the decompiled scripts is always true.
I think that unkFlag, like the driving styles, could be a flag that ""work as a list of 32 bits converted to a decimal integer. Each bit acts as a flag, and enables or disables a function"". What leads me to this conclusion is the fact that in the decompiled scripts, unkFlag takes values like: 0, 1, 5 (101 in binary) and 4097 (4096 + 1 or 1000000000001 in binary). For now, I don't know what behavior enable or disable this possible flag so I leave it at 0.
Note: After some testing, using unkFlag = 16 (0x10) enables the use of sidewalks while moving towards goToLocation.
The aimingFlag takes 2 values: 0 to aim at the focusLocation, 1 to aim at where the ped is heading (goToLocation).
Example:
enum AimFlag
{
   AimAtFocusLocation,
   AimAtGoToLocation
};
Vector3 goToLocation1 = { 996.2867f, 0, -2143.044f, 0, 28.4763f, 0 }; // remember the padding.
Vector3 goToLocation2 = { 990.2867f, 0, -2140.044f, 0, 28.4763f, 0 }; // remember the padding.
Vector3 focusLocation = { 994.3478f, 0, -2136.118f, 0, 29.2463f, 0 }; // the coord z should be a little higher, around +1.0f to avoid aiming at the ground
// 1st example
TASK::TASK_GO_TO_COORD_AND_AIM_AT_HATED_ENTITIES_NEAR_COORD(pedHandle, goToLocation1.x, goToLocation1.y, goToLocation1.z, focusLocation.x, focusLocation.y, focusLocation.z, 2.0f /*run*/, true /*shoot*/, 3.0f /*stop at*/, 0.0f /*noRoadsDistance*/, true /*always true*/, 0 /*possible flag*/, AimFlag::AimAtGoToLocation, -957453492 /*FullAuto pattern*/);
// 2nd example
TASK::TASK_GO_TO_COORD_AND_AIM_AT_HATED_ENTITIES_NEAR_COORD(pedHandle, goToLocation2.x, goToLocation2.y, goToLocation2.z, focusLocation.x, focusLocation.y, focusLocation.z, 1.0f /*walk*/, false /*don't shoot*/, 3.0f /*stop at*/, 0.0f /*noRoadsDistance*/, true /*always true*/, 0 /*possible flag*/, AimFlag::AimAtFocusLocation, -957453492 /*FullAuto pattern*/);
1st example: The ped (pedhandle) will run towards goToLocation1. While running and aiming towards goToLocation1, the ped will shoot on sight to any enemy in his path, using ""FullAuto"" firing pattern. The ped will stop once he is closer than distanceToStopAt to goToLocation1.
2nd example: The ped will walk towards goToLocation2. This time, while walking towards goToLocation2 and aiming at focusLocation, the ped will point his weapon on sight to any enemy in his path without shooting. The ped will stop once he is closer than distanceToStopAt to goToLocation2.

The entity will move towards the target until time is over (duration) or get in target's range (distance). p5 and p6 are unknown, but you could leave p5 = 1073741824 or 100 or even 0 (didn't see any difference but on the decompiled scripts, they use 1073741824 mostly) and p6 = 0
Note: I've only tested it on entity -> ped and target -> vehicle. It could work differently on other entities, didn't try it yet.
Example: TASK::TASK_GO_TO_ENTITY(pedHandle, vehicleHandle, 5000, 4.0, 100, 1073741824, 0)
Ped will run towards the vehicle for 5 seconds and stop when time is over or when he gets 4 meters(?) around the vehicle (with duration = -1, the task duration will be ignored).

int mode seams to set mission type 4 = coords target, 23 = ped target.
int 14 set to 32 = ped will land at destination.
My findings:
mode 4 or 7 forces heli to snap to the heading set
8 makes the heli flee from the ped.
9 circles around ped with angle set
10, 11 normal + imitate ped heading
20 makes the heli land when he's near the ped. It won't resume chasing.
21 emulates an helicopter crash
23 makes the heli circle erratically around ped
I change p2 to 'vehicleToFollow' as it seems to work like the task natives to set targets. In the heli_taxi script where as the merryweather heli takes you to your waypoint it has no need to follow a vehicle or a ped, so of course both have 0 set.

After looking at some scripts the second parameter seems to be an id of some kind. Here are some I found from some R* scripts:
""miss_Tower_01"" (this went from 01 - 10)
""miss_Ass0"" (0, 4, 6, 3)
""MISS_PATROL_8""
I think they're patrol routes, but I'm not sure. And I believe the 3rd parameter is a BOOL, but I can't confirm other than only seeing 0 and 1 being passed.
As far as I can see the patrol routes names such as ""miss_Ass0"" have been defined earlier in the scripts. This leads me to believe we can defined our own new patrol routes by following the same approach.

EDITED (7/13/2017)  
NOTE: If you want air combat, AI::TASK_COMBAT_PED (while your pilot is in an aircraft) also does the same thing as this native.  
DESCRIPTION:  
Ever wish your buddy could shoot down one of your enemies for you? Ever wanted an auto-pilot? Well look no further! This is the native for you! (Ped intelligence may vary)  
USAGE:  
-- REQUIRED --  
• pilot = The ped flying the aircraft.  
• aircraft = The aircraft the pilot is flying  
-- OPTIONAL -- [atleast 1 must be assigned]  
• targetVehicle = The vehicle the pilot will target.  
• targetPed = The ped the pilot will target.  
• destinationX, destinationY, destinationZ = The location the pilot will target.  
-- LOGIC --  
• missionFlag = The type of mission. pastebin.com/R8x73dbv  
• angularDrag = The higher the value, the slower the plane will rotate. Value ranges from 0 - Infinity.  
• unk = Set to 0, and you'll be fine.  
• targetHeading = The target angle (from world space north) that the pilot will try to acheive before executing an attack/landing.  
• maxZ = Maximum Z coordinate height for flying.  
• minZ = Minimum Z coordinate height for flying.  
Z: 2,700 is the default max height a pilot will be able to fly. Anything greater and he will fly downward until reaching 2,700 again.

I cant believe I have to define this, this is one of the best natives.  
It makes the ped ignore basically all shocking events around it. Occasionally the ped may comment or gesture, but other than that they just continue their daily activities. This includes shooting and wounding the ped. And - most importantly - they do not flee.

---------------
The first parameter in every scenario has always been a Ped of some sort. The second like TASK_START_SCENARIO_IN_PLACE is the name of the scenario.
The next 4 parameters were harder to decipher. After viewing ""hairdo_shop_mp.ysc.c4"", and being confused from seeing the case in other scripts, they passed the first three of the arguments as one array from a function, and it looked like it was obviously x, y, and z.
I haven't seen the sixth parameter go to or over 360, making me believe that it is rotation, but I really can't confirm anything.
I have no idea what the last 3 parameters are, but I'll try to find out.

In every case of this native, I've only seen the first parameter passed as 0, although I believe it's a Ped after seeing tasks around it using 0. That's because it's used in a Sequence Task.  
The last 3 parameters are definitely coordinates after seeing them passed in other scripts, and even being used straight from the player's coordinates.  
---  
It seems that - in the decompiled scripts - this native was used on a ped who was in a vehicle to throw a projectile out the window at the player. This is something any ped will naturally do if they have a throwable and they are doing driveby-combat (although not very accurately).  
It is possible, however, that this is how SWAT throws smoke grenades at the player when in cover.  
----------------------------------------------------  
The first comment is right it definately is the ped as if you look in script finale_heist2b.c line 59628 in Xbox Scripts atleast you will see task_throw_projectile and the first param is Local_559[2 <14>] if you look above it a little bit line 59622 give_weapon_to_ped uses the same exact param Local_559[2 <14>] and we all know the first param of that native is ped. So it guaranteed has to be ped. 0 just may mean to use your ped by default for some reason.

pilot, vehicle and altitude are rather self-explanatory.  
p4: is unused variable in the function.  
entityToFollow: you can provide a Vehicle entity or a Ped entity, the heli will protect them.  
'targetSpeed':  The pilot will dip the nose AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE so as to reach this value AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.  As such, you'll want to modulate it as opposed to calling it via a hard-wired, constant #.  
'radius' isn't just ""stop within radius of X of target"" like with ground vehicles.  In this case, the pilot will fly an entire circle around 'radius' and continue to do so.  
NOT CONFIRMED:  p7 appears to be a FlyingStyle enum.  Still investigating it as of this writing, but playing around with values here appears to result in different -behavior- as opposed to offsetting coordinates, altitude, target speed, etc.  
NOTE: If the pilot finds enemies, it will engage them until it kills them, but will return to protect the ped/vehicle given shortly thereafter.

TASK,0x195AEEB13CEFE2EE,TASK_VEHICLE_GOTO_NAVMESH,"ped:Ped, vehicle:Vehicle, x:float, y:float, z:float, speed:float, behaviorFlag:int, stoppingRange:float",void,"```
Differs from TASK_VEHICLE_DRIVE_TO_COORDS in that it will pick the shortest possible road route without taking one-way streets and other ""road laws"" into consideration.  
WARNING:  
A behaviorFlag value of 0 will result in a clunky, stupid driver!  
Recommended settings:  
speed = 30.0f,  
behaviorFlag = 156,   
stoppingRange = 5.0f;  
If you simply want to have your driver move to a fixed location, call it only once, or, when necessary in the event of interruption.   
If using this to continually follow a Ped who is on foot:  You will need to run this in a tick loop.  Call it in with the Ped's updated coordinates every 20 ticks or so and you will have one hell of a smart, fast-reacting NPC driver -- provided he doesn't get stuck.  If your update frequency is too fast, the Ped may not have enough time to figure his way out of being stuck, and thus, remain stuck.  One way around this would be to implement an ""anti-stuck"" mechanism, which allows the driver to realize he's stuck, temporarily pause the tick, unstuck, then resume the tick.

Example usage  
VEHICLE::GET_CLOSEST_VEHICLE(x, y, z, radius, hash, unknown leave at 70)   
x, y, z: Position to get closest vehicle to.  
radius: Max radius to get a vehicle.  
modelHash: Limit to vehicles with this model. 0 for any.  
flags: The bitwise flags altering the function's behaviour.  
Does not return police cars or helicopters.  
It seems to return police cars for me, does not seem to return helicopters, planes or boats for some reason  
Only returns non police cars and motorbikes with the flag set to 70 and modelHash to 0. ModelHash seems to always be 0 when not a modelHash in the scripts, as stated above.   
These flags were found in the b617d scripts: 0,2,4,6,7,23,127,260,2146,2175,12294,16384,16386,20503,32768,67590,67711,98309,100359.  
Converted to binary, each bit probably represents a flag as explained regarding another native here: gtaforums.com/topic/822314-guide-driving-styles  
Conversion of found flags to binary: pastebin.com/kghNFkRi  
At exactly 16384 which is 0100000000000000 in binary and 4000 in hexadecimal only planes are returned.   
It's probably more convenient to use worldGetAllVehicles(int *arr, int arrSize) and check the shortest distance yourself and sort if you want by checking the vehicle type with for example VEHICLE::IS_THIS_MODEL_A_BOAT  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Conclusion: This native is not worth trying to use. Use something like this instead: pastebin.com/xiFdXa7h
Use flag 127 to return police cars
